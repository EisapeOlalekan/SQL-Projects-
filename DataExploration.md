# Covid Data Analysis (SQL Data Exploration)
Projects that involves the use of Structured Query Language to explore data and fine dthe insight of data 
## Objective
This Project aims to explore and visualize Data about the Covid-19 Pandemic to uncover certain insights from the start and identify areas or patterns to dig into more.
## Data Source
The data is publicly available on the following website.
It is important to note that this data source is constantly updated. However, as at the time this project was carried out, the data was last updated on the 12th December, 2022. Hence, the insights generated from the exploration of this data is based on Covid-19 data from the 1st of January, 2020 till 12th December, 2022.
## Data Processing
The data was processed and prepared for analysis (in SQL) using MS-Excel. Irrelevant columns were removed, the data was confirmed to be duplicates-free and the dataset was seperated into two Tables (titled CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations) to ensure distinction and clarity of purpose while analyzing the data. The two tables were later joined in SQL during analysis.
